Resting State EEG LEMON



Resting state EEG recording design
A 16 min resting state EEG (corresponding to 16 blocks each lasting for 1 min) consisted of eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) conditions. EC and EO changed in every block which in total formed 8 blocks each. Half of the participants started the resting state EEG recording with EC condition, while another half with EO.



I. Raw rsEEG data 

The folder contains raw resting state EEG data files (Brain Vision files). 

Marker coding: 
S200 - eyes open rest
S210 - eyes closed rest



II. Preprocessed resting state EEG data

The folder contains preprocessed EEG data files after removing ICA components separately for eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) conditions. Each participant (N= 202) have 4 files (2 for EC condition and 2 for EO). These .set and .fdt files have the following naming structure:

sub-BIDS_condition.fdt (.set)

*condition: eyes closed (EC) or eyes open(EO)
 BIDS number: 6-digit numbers created for data-paper (e.g., sub-032301)


 
III. Digitized EEG channel locations

Polhemus PATRIOT Motion Tracking System (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA) localizer together with the Brainstorm toolbox was used to digitize the exact location of each electrode on a participant's head relative to three fiducial points.
